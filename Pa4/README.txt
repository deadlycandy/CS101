README

The overall goal of the program is to:
1.Read in a text file 
2.Input the lines into an array
3.Use a list ADT to sort it indirectly
4.Then print into an outfile.

Files:
List.h: The header file for the List ADT. It contains all the functions definitions that can be used by the client. 
List.c: The c file for the List ADT where all the functions are writen out. Not all functions in the file are avaliable for the client.
Lex.c: This file uses the List ADT to sort an array of text indrectly using a List and List functions.
ListClient.c: A tester file to ensure that the list is performing correctly.
Makefile: Use to compile all the neccessary files to create a working Lex excutable.
