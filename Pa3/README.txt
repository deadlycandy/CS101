Objective: Create a sparse matrix and perform matrix operations. Using a combination of array's and lists to create a sparse matrix.

Files:
1. List.java: This is a generic List ADT, that can be used for multiple data types. This is used to represent the rows in the matrix. 
2. ListTest.java: Displays that the List is working correctly.
3. Matrix.java: Matrix class that creates an Array of List along with multiple matrix specfic operations. (Works on sparse matrixs)
4. MatrixTest.java: Test the correctness of the Matrix class.
5. Sparse.java: Takes in values from an in file then performs multiple matrix operations on the two initalized arrays. Prints the output to an out file.
6. MakeFile: creates an excutable
